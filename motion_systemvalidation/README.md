# Overview
This is the "System validation" dataset.
It contains motion data collected from 4 subjects
Detailed description of the paradigm can be found in the following reference:

This dataset contains data from both healthy subjects and patients with neurological diseases (Parkinsonâ€™s disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, chronic low back pain). The full bodies of 167 subjects were measured with IMUs and an optical motion capture (reference) system. Subjects performed multiple standardized mobility assessments and non-standardized activities of daily living. The data of 21 healthy subjects are shared online, data of the other subjects and patients can only be obtained after contacting the corresponding author and signing a data sharing agreement.
